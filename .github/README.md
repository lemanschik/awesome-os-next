# awesome-os-next
just-build based Awesome OS Distribution - Containing Experiments
It also contains components-osjs-hyperapp development as we use it here as outer layer of the UI layout for fun
in a demo

https://github.lemanschik.com/chromium-virtual-environments

## Why?
I as a Developer wanted to be able to produce next gen Software without all the problems that come with todays Patterns and Methods. 
I also want to be able to reuse existing code and make it even better most best Automated via AI and or Declarativ CodeMods.

I also wanted to ship updateable software including sync and all the other stuff a modern Application Platform needs.
I needed Editor Support and Remote Connection Transports and creating Extensions for varius systems sucks.

In general writing code that works on many systems sucks. So the idea was to create a awesome os that works on any system and can produce software that runs standalone on any system. As also handle all Platform needs and even deploy Platforms that Sync if needed to Scale. I did not want to depend on
cloud api's or any none generic apis as this is always adding overhead of maintainance and bugs. No Code is the best code Awesome OS Archives that
most complet at present for me.

## How?
It is based on it self and offers a Chromium Platform Build and Dependencie Manager as also the needed Infrastructure to deploy and compile chromium it self as also all Operating Systems that depend on it like Fuchsia, Android. Plus Containerized new Modern Component Builds of Platforms Parts like v8
and webkit to allow faster better embedded App build support.
